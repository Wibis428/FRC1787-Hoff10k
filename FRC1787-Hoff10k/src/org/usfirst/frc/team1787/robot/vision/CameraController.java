  /* The following data is taken from the 
   * Microsoft Lifecam HD 3000 technical data sheet, 
   * which can be found online from Microsoft.
   * 
   * Native Image Width = 1280 pixels   (taken from data sheet)
   * Native Image Height = 720 pixels   (taken from data sheet)
   * Diagonal FOV in degrees = 68.5     (taken from data sheet)
   * Horizontal FOV in degrees = 61.39  (calculated using HorizontalFOV equation)
   * Vertical FOV in degrees = 36.93    (calculated using VerticalFOV equation)
   * Focal Length in pixels (for native resolution only!) = 1078 (calculated using focalLengthPixels equation)
   * 
   * First of all, it can be seen from the native image width and height that
   * the camera is designed to take pictures/video using a 16:9 aspect ratio.
   * However, for reasons unknown to me at the time, it appears that OpenCV doesn't play nice with 16:9 aspect ratios.
   * None of the image processing functions seemed to work on images with that aspect ratio.
   * To overcome this obstacle, we can set the resolution of the camera (using the .setResolution() method)
   * to a resolution with a different aspect ratio. Testing reveals that a 4:3 aspect ratio works,
   * so that's the ratio we're currently using.
   * Unfortunately, this has a significant effect on how easy it is to obtain the camera's focal length, 
   * which is needed to determine the target's location relative to the robot. 
   * This issue is outlined below.
   * 
   * Note: Please read up a bit on "the pinhole camera model" before reading the rest of this comment.
   * It will make more sense if you have some context.
   * 
   * In general, the focal length is a physical/geometric property of the camera and therefore doesn't change.
   * The USB camera used on the robot is no exception.
   * However, it's important to note that the focal length can change if it's being measured in pixels. 
   * This is because the size of 1 pixel in an image doesn't always correspond to the same amount of physical space.
   * For example, consider a picture that is 320 inches wide and 240 inches tall.
   * Let the focal length of the camera used to take the picture be 2 inches.
   * If the resolution of that picture is 320 pixels wide by 240 pixels tall, 
   * then the width and height of each pixel is 1 inch.
   * This means that the focal length, as measured in pixels, would be 2 pixels long.
   * However, if we increase the resolution of the image to 640 by 480 pixels
   * while keeping its physical size the same, each pixel then has a width and height of 0.5 inches.
   * Now the focal length as measured in pixels would be 4 pixels long, 
   * even though it's physical size of 2 inches never changed.
   * 
   * Keeping this in mind, consider the fact that the aspect ratio we're using isn't the same as 
   * the native aspect ratio. This means that when we request a 4:3 image from the camera, 
   * it will have to do something different than what it normally does in order to comply with our request.
   * Here are a few examples:
   * 
   * 1) The camera may take a picture at its native resolution, 
   * then crop the image so that is has a 4:3 aspect ratio.
   * 
   * 2) The camera may only uses a subset of its pixels to 
   * take pictures using a 4:3 aspect ratio.
   * 
   * 3) The camera may squeeze or stretch the image 
   * until it has a 4:3 aspect ratio.
   * 
   * There may also be other possibilities, but the point is that the image is being manipulated even before 
   * it's scanned for targets. Specifically, the image is being manipulated in a way that may change the effective
   * FOV of the camera. This means that the FOV of the camera must be determined manually, 
   * so it can be used to calculate the focal length of the camera in pixels.
   * 
   * (Side note: As far as I know, changing the resolution of the camera
   * but keeping the aspect ratio the same will have no effect on the FOV, 
   * just the crispness of the image. So once you calculate the FOV for any 
   * resolution with a 4:3 aspect ratio, that should be the same FOV for all
   * other resolutions with a 4:3 aspect ratio. This is just based on what 
   * I remember from my time with the robot, it could very well be incorrect.)
   * 
   * If you look at the equations for focal length listed at the beginning of this comment, you will see that
   * it doen't matter which FOV you calculate, whether it be the horizontal FOV, vertical FOV, or Diagonal FOV.
   * Any one of them can be used to calculate the focal length in pixels. However, there's an important assumption 
   * that these equations make, which is that the pixels in the image are square. Though this is normally true, 
   * it doesn't necessarily remain true when you use an aspect ratio that's different
   * than the native aspect ratio of the camera.
   * 
   * Consider the possibility that the camera converts from 16:9 to 4:3 by "re-grouping" its pixels.
   * For example, say we wanted to go from the native resolution of 1280 by 720 to the 4:3 resolution of 320 by 240.
   * The camera sees that we want a width of 320 pixels, so it divides the 1280 pixels it has 
   * into 320 groups of 4 (1280 / 320 = 4). 
   * It also sees that we want a height of 240 pixels, so it divides the 720 pixels it has 
   * into 240 groups of 3 (720 / 240 = 3). 
   * Now the imaging sensor is effectively divided into an array of "super pixels", 
   * each one composed of a 4 by 3 grid of the native pixels. 
   * The camera then simply considers each of these "super pixels" as one pixel when taking a picture.
   * This results in pixels that are wider than they are tall, which makes it even more
   * difficult to measure the focal length in pixels. This is because the "length" of a pixel 
   * isn't consistent between the vertical and horizontal directions. 
   * 
   * Given all of these complications, simply defining 2 different ways of representing the focal length 
   * seems to be the most simple and robust solution to me. These 2 representations would be:
   * 
   * 1) The focal length as measured by the height of pixels, 
   * which can be defined from the vertical FOV, 
   * and will be used to calculate the distance to the target.
   * 
   * 2) The focal length as measured by the width of pixels, 
   * which can be defined from the horizontal FOV, 
   * and will be used to calculate the angle between the target and the turret.
   * 
   * This will also allow for much easier testing.
   * For example, if the turret seems to be working fine but the distance calculation appears to be off, 
   * all we have to do is recalculate the value for the focal length that's defined by the vertical FOV, 
   * and we don't have to worry about that change having any effect on the performance of the turret.
