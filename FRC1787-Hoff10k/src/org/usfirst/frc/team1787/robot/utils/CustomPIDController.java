/**
 * This class is provided to fix some issues with the given PIDController class.
 * Namely, the onTarget() method isn't working due to the way it's implemented,
 * so a fix is provided here.
 * 
 * The problem is that the onTarget method checks to see if the average error is within
 * acceptable bounds. Because the average error is reset every time setSetpoint is called, 
 * and because setSetpoint is being called continuously, there is never a valid average error.
 * Therefore, the included onTaget() method will never return true if setSetpoint() is called
 * continuously.
 * 
 * The fix: Override the onTarget() method so that it just checks the current error rather than
 * the average.
 * 
 * Also adds some additional functionality, which is in the documentation for the methods below.
